<h3>4.2 Publication related data</h3>

<p>
	<b>Scope and Purpose:</b> The chemotion repository is a service to publish research data and to make them available in
	the long
	run. Therefore, the scientific content is published along with authors&apos; and contributors&apos; information to
	ensure good

	the
	process of publication and the visibility of information can be retrieved from the documentation of the chemotion
	repository (<a href="https://www.chemotion.net/docs/repo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"

<h3>4.3 Sending data to other services</h3>
<b>Scope and Purpose:</b> Chemotion repository provides data to other services via different interfaces and protocols.
This is
done to ensure that the research data (a) can be reused by others, (b) gets identifiers required for further purposes,
and (c) is visible in the community worldwide and promotes the work of the scientists. Sending the data to Datacite and
Pubchem is an integral part of the “Chemotion Repository” processes.
<ul>
	<li>The <b>service DataCite</b> is used to register persistent identifiers for research data. The registration
		requires the
		provision of general information on the authors and contributors of the research data which corresponds to the
		information that is required for a publication in the Chemotion repository (4.2, 1-4). The data privacy policy of
		DataCite can be retrieved from here: <a href="https://datacite.org/privacy-policy/" target="_blank"

		</a></li>
	<li>In parallel to the release of research data, information on the published samples is provided to PubChem for a
		registration in the PubChem database. The information transferred to PubChem does not contain any information on the
		users of the chemotion repository, it refers to the service Chemotion repository in general. No authors&apos; or
		contributors’ data are provided to PubChem.</li>
</ul>

<h3>5. Data processing when you contact us</h3>
<b>Legal Basis:</b> The legal basis for data processing is Art. 6 par. 1 (e), par 3 GDPR in conjunction with § 4 LDSG.

	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	<b>Storage Period:</b> The personal data will be stored for as long as it is necessary to fulfill the above-mentioned
	purpose,
	i.e. the data will be deleted when it can be assumed that an exchange is no longer desired. The inquiry is not stored
	and handled per email only.
</p>

<h3>5.2 System related information exchange</h3>
<p>
	The repository Chemotion offers the option to review data and to communicate with the reviewers via the system. The
	information on the scientific review process is stored in the database of the chemotion repository and kept for
	quality
	assurance reasons and a transparent reviewing process. The data provided related to the review process should
	therefore
	be kept short and precise and should not contain any personal data . The pure scientific information is stored with
	the
	user&apos;s acronym avoiding a direct correlation to individual persons.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Note:</b> We would like to point out that data transmission over the Internet (e.g. when communicating by e-mail)
	may be
	subject to security vulnerabilities. Complete protection of data against access by third parties is not possible.

</p>

<h3>6. Web analysis with Matomo (formerly PIWIK)</h3>
<p>
	<b>Scope and purpose:</b> We use the open source software tool Matomo (formerly PIWIK) on our website to analyze
	surfing
	behavior. By analyzing the data obtained, we are able to compile information about the use of the individual
	components of our website and draw conclusions about the success of the “Chemotion Repository” from the access
	figures.
</p>
When individual pages of our website are accessed, the following data is stored:
<ul>
	<li>Anonymized IP address</li>
	<li>Date and time of access</li>
	<li>Time zone difference to Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)</li>
	<li>Content of the access (concrete site)</li>
	<li>Status of access/HTTP status code</li>
	<li>Data volume transmitted</li>
	<li>Website from which an accessing system reaches our website</li>
	<li>Browser</li>
</ul>
<p>
	We operate Matomo in a version that does not require cookies. Thus, no Matomo cookies are stored on your computer for
	the purpose of web analysis. Only the technically necessary log data (see above and no. 2) is used to analyze website
	usage. The software is set so that the IP addresses are not saved in full, but 2 bytes of the IP address are masked
	(e.g.: 192.168.xxx.xxx). In this way, it is no longer possible to assign the shortened IP address to the calling
	computer.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Recipient:</b> The software runs exclusively on the servers of our website. Users' personal data is only stored
	there. The
	data is not passed on to third parties.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Legal Basis:</b> The legal basis for data processing is Art. 6 par. 1 (e), par 3 GDPR in conjunction with § 4 LDSG.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Storage Period:</b> The data is deleted as soon as it is no longer required for our recording purposes.
</p>

<p>
	<b>Tip:</b> If you prefer not to be included in these statistics, you can opt out at any time via our <a
		href="https://www.chemotion-repository.net/home/opt-out">Matomo opt-out
		page</a>. In this case, an
	opt-out cookie is stored in your browser, which prevents Matomo from storing usage data. If you delete your cookies,
	the Matomo opt-out cookie will also be deleted. The opt-out must be reactivated when you visit our site again. You can
	deactivate or restrict the storage of cookies by changing the settings in your internet browser. Most modern browsers
	have a so-called “Do Not Track” option, with which they tell websites not to track your user activities. We have
	configured Matomo to respect this option Matomo respects this option.
</p>

<h3>7. TLS encryption</h3>
<p>
	This site uses TLS encryption for security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential content, such as
	the
	requests you send to us as the site operator. You can recognize an encrypted connection by the fact that the address
	line of the browser changes from “http://” to “https://” and by the lock symbol in your browser line.
</p>
<p>
	If TLS encryption is activated, the data you transmit to us cannot generally be read by third parties. Please note,
	however, that when data is transmitted over the Internet, it is never possible to guarantee complete protection
	against
	access by third parties.
</p>
