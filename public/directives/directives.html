<h2>2. Data content</h2>

<h3>2.1 Responsibility for data contents</h3>

There are two types of contributed contents, unpublished and published contributed contents. <br>
User contributed content (unpublished): the user may upload user data which are not visible for other users, this content is visible only if the user is logged in or if he/she shares the content with other users.
User contributed content (published): If the user selects single items or item groups to publish, the content will become available as open access for other users. The contents will be visible for the public and registered users will be able to download the content including the provided files.
All uploaded contents are stored by the user in person. The data stored by him/her are always linked to the user&apos;s account data in the database of the storage system. Even if the account of a user is deleted, the connection of the stored data to the user&apos;s username (as defined with the registration) will be conserved.
